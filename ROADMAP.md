# SoundCraft roadmap

**Stage: pre-alpha** · next: alpha, ~5% and ~110–180 h away (the alpha gate's three failing workflows)

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-10 · **Change:** minor (readiness by audience with hours to ~95 %) · **Target:** Avid Pro Tools Ultimate 2026.4.1

SoundCraft is a clean-room, pure-Rust digital audio workstation that aims at full parity with
Avid Pro Tools, and then beyond it: faster, open, scriptable and agent-controllable. This page is
the one-page summary; the detail is in [`docs/target-app-parity.md`](docs/target-app-parity.md)
(assessment), [`docs/gaps.md`](docs/gaps.md) (ranked work list), [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md)
(milestones and beta plan) and [`docs/parity-checklist.md`](docs/parity-checklist.md) (generated
menu checklist).

## Headline numbers

| Number | Value | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| Menu breadth | **482 / 512 Pro Tools menu leaves (94.1 %)**; engine alone 397 / 512 | measured (`cargo xtask parity` + UI-layer aliases) |
| Feature breadth | **~70 %** | estimated (menus plus plugins, hardware, formats, immersive, cloud) |
| **Ready for real work** | **~40 %** | estimated, weighted by dimension |
| Mainstream practitioner (tracking/mixing engineer) | **~36 %** | estimated: 50.6 % weekly-area depth × 0.90 interaction × 0.92 stability × 0.85 file exchange ([how](docs/target-app-parity.md#mainstream-practitioner-and-essentials-user)) |
| Essentials user (song or podcast, defaults) | **~57 %** | estimated: 72.4 % core-feature depth × 0.90 launch/stability × 0.90 discoverability × 0.97 files ([how](docs/target-app-parity.md#mainstream-practitioner-and-essentials-user)) |
| Remaining to alpha | **~110–180 Opus 5.5 agent-hours** (the failing gate rows) | estimated, calibrated on PR history |
| Remaining to beta | **~350–570 Opus 5.5 agent-hours** (includes the alpha work; ~60–70 % parallelizable) | estimated |
| Remaining to full parity | **~950–1,450 Opus 5.5 agent-hours** | estimated |

| Audience | Ready % | Agent-hours to ~95 % | Work that dominates |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Full target (ready for real work) | ~40 % | ~950–1,450 h | Hardware, the stock plugin catalogue, AAF/OMF and immersive, localization, fidelity |
| Mainstream practitioner | ~36 % | ~380–600 h | Interface and MIDI recording, AAF/OMF, stock-plugin depth, core-path bugs |
| Essentials user | ~57 % | ~110–200 h | Launch and platform fixes, onboarding, effect panels and presets, MP3/AAC export |

Hours are Opus 5.5 agent wall-clock hours, calibrated on this repo's PRs; 60–70 % parallelizes.
Detail: [target-app-parity.md](docs/target-app-parity.md#readiness-by-audience).

**Why pre-alpha:** the core-workflow gate in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md#alpha-gate) fails.
Editing, mixing, bouncing, and saving and reopening work end to end. But a Pro Tools user can't
record from a chosen audio interface at a chosen buffer size (only the default devices, a fixed
512-sample block, and takes held in RAM). They can't record MIDI from a keyboard (there is no
MIDI device layer). And they can't bring a session in or hand one back (no AAF/OMF/`.ptx`).
Readiness (~40 %) sits right at the alpha bar, but a gate failure keeps the app pre-alpha. The
2026-10-07 estimate ("~65 % overall, 110–150 h to 100 %") counted feature presence. This one
measures readiness and adds hardware, localization and field bug reports.

## Upcoming

Ranked; the alpha gate, the alpha checklist and the beta plan are in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

1. **Alpha blocker:** audio interfaces: device and buffer-size choice, duplex stream, ASIO; record to disk (G-01, G-06). 35–55 h.
2. **Alpha blocker:** MIDI devices: record from keyboards, play instruments live, output (G-02). 20–35 h.
3. **Alpha blocker:** AAF/OMF import and export (G-03). 50–90 h.
4. macOS plugin entitlement (#153), then AU editors (G-05). 1 h for the entitlement (needed for the mix row), then 15–25 h.
5. Land the open bug-fix PRs and clear the correctness backlog (G-04). 15–25 h.
6. PR CI running `cargo xtask ci` on three OSes (G-14). 5–10 h.
7. Fidelity harness against Pro Tools (G-07). 20–30 h.

## Robustness

Property tests drive random edit sequences (with full undo), mutated session files and hostile
command parameters through the engine and mixer; they have caught fade, overflow and
unbounded-allocation bugs. Every command also runs with empty parameters on empty and demo
sessions. Hosted plugins live in isolated unsafe crates (`clap-host`, `vst3-host`, `au-host`) and
are created, loaded and destroyed off the audio thread. The video decoders survive hundreds of
mutated and truncated movies. Field reports from the first public week are tracked in
[gaps.md](docs/gaps.md) (G-04).

## Progress log

- **2026-10-10** — Stage re-normalized to **pre-alpha** by the core-workflow gate (interface recording, MIDI recording and session interchange fail). Full re-measure against Pro Tools Ultimate 2026.4.1 and the standard
  progress-docs set (this page, target-app parity, gaps, roadmap, UI/format/hardware/plugin/
  localization parity). v0.4.0 released. Community fixes: Cut All Automation, snap to neighbours,
  tempo stretch, I/O Setup, clip export names, menu-only dialogs, playback stop on new session.
- **2026-10-09** — Light theme and live system appearance, clip-gain fader and nudge, missing-media
  warnings, session audio health, malformed-JSON and encoder-extension checks in the CLI, macOS
  system menu bar, Windows DX12 default, Linux fontconfig, metronome click in playback.
- **2026-10-08** — v0.2.x–v0.3.0 released (Flatpak, AppImage zsync); VST3 quit crash fixed;
  Ctrl-as-Cmd shortcuts on Windows/Linux; plugin menus by vendor, AU inserts, instrument picker;
  rotating log file; branded DMG.
- **2026-10-07** — Repository published; About window credits; release CI on macOS runners.
- **2026-10-06** — Video track, Audio Unit hosting, plugin state and editors, Renderer; Mix
  window views; score export and print; surround mixing; VST3 hosting; property tests.
- **2026-10-05** — Foundation crates, Edit and Mix windows, playback, CLI/MCP, parity report,
  recording and punch, CLAP hosting, Elastic Audio, Beat Detective, release pipeline.
