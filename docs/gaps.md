# Where SoundCraft falls short of Pro Tools

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-10 · **Change:** minor (alpha blockers marked after the core-workflow gate) · **Target:** Avid Pro Tools Ultimate 2026.4.1

Every known shortfall, one entry each, ranked by how much it stops a Pro Tools user from doing
real work in SoundCraft. This is the work list: pick from the top. Rows marked **alpha blocker**
fail the core-workflow gate in [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md#alpha-gate) and keep SoundCraft pre-alpha. Numbers and weights live in
[`target-app-parity.md`](target-app-parity.md); the plan that orders these into milestones is
[`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md). Hours are Opus 5.5 agent-hours (calibration in target-app-parity.md).
Estimates marked "≈" are judgements; issue numbers are `storytold/soundcraft` GitHub issues.

When you close a gap, delete its entry (or shrink it) in the same PR, and bump the timestamp.

## Details

### G-01. Audio interface support

- **Missing:** choosing the output or input device, the device's channel count and routing to
  physical channels, the buffer size, and the sample rate from the hardware side. Input and
  output are separate cpal streams on the *default* devices (`crates/playback/src/lib.rs`
  `open_device`, `record.rs`); the mix runs in fixed 512-sample blocks and resamples when rates
  differ. `setup.playback_engine` stores `device`/`buffer_size` params, but playback ignores them.
  No ASIO on Windows (WASAPI shared only), so latency there is high.
- **Evidence:** code above; Playback Engine window says "Mix block size: 512 samples"; issue #42
  (no input device selection, forced monitoring feedback with virtual routing).
- **Impact:** blocks tracking with any multichannel interface; latency makes overdubs hard.
- **Estimate:** ≈ 25–40 h (device enumeration and selection, buffer size, duplex stream with one
  clock, ASIO feature build, per-channel I/O mapping into I/O Setup, latency reporting and
  record-offset compensation). Needs hands-on hardware testing.

### G-02. MIDI devices

- **Missing:** all MIDI hardware I/O. No `midir`/CoreMIDI/WinMM/ALSA sequencer code exists;
  `setup.midi_input_devices` and `setup.midi_studio` only store names. You cannot record from a
  keyboard, play a hosted instrument live, drive external synths, or send MIDI clock/MTC.
  `midi_editor.rs:288` notes audition "needs a live MIDI input path".
- **Impact:** MIDI production is limited to drawing notes and importing SMF.
- **Estimate:** ≈ 20–35 h (device layer, realtime input to armed tracks and instruments with
  timestamps, MIDI record/merge/loop, thru, output tracks, clock out).

### G-03. Session interchange with Pro Tools

- **Missing:** opening or saving `.ptx`/`.ptf`, AAF and OMF import and export (#40), Media
  Composer–compatible sessions. Our session format is `.scraft` JSON.
- **Impact:** the standard's main-format bar for beta. A Pro Tools user cannot bring a project in
  or hand one back; post-production (picture editors deliver AAF) is blocked.
- **Estimate:** AAF/OMF import + export ≈ 50–90 h (FilmCraft already writes AAF/OMF; we can learn
  from it but not share code). `.ptx` is proprietary and undocumented: owner decision on whether
  black-box format study is in the clean-room rules; not included in the estimate.

### G-04. Correctness bugs in "done" features

Open on 2026-10-10 (several have PRs open):
editing #3, #5, #140, #144; clip/session #86 (PR #123), #88 (PR #130), #91 (PR #124), #92 (PR #132);
automation #104 (PR #134); mix/bounce #59 (PR #131), #103 (PR #133), #152; playback #101 (PR #129);
MIDI #87, #98 (PR #125); import #89 (PR #128); CLI #95, #96 (PR #126, #127); MCP #145 (PR #146);
web #63, #64, #136; Clip List #4 (PR #75); plugin view #6; shortcuts #7, #41;
launch #142; Linux #45, #107.
- **Impact:** each one is small, but together they say "presence is not parity": an outside
  contributor found seven in one sitting (#116–#122).
- **Estimate:** ≈ 25–40 h at 0.5–1.5 h each, plus review of the open PRs.

### G-05. Plugin hosting on macOS

- **Missing:** the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement in the signed
  build, so hardened runtime refuses third-party VST3 bundles (#153, #149). AU editor views
  (`crates/au-host/src/lib.rs` header: "Not hosted yet: Audio Unit editor views"). Embedded CLAP
  GUIs; VST3 editors on Windows/Linux.
- **Estimate:** ≈ 15–25 h (entitlement ≈ 1 h; AU Cocoa views and VST3 HWND/X11 views most of it).

### G-06. Memory-bound media

- **Missing:** streaming sources from disk; recording to disk. Every source is decoded whole into
  the `SourcePool`; takes accumulate in RAM until stop (PR #84 open).
- **Impact:** hour-long multitrack sessions and long takes exhaust memory; a crash during a long
  take loses it.
- **Estimate:** ≈ 15–25 h.

### G-07. Fidelity harness against Pro Tools

- **Missing:** any measured comparison: null tests of bounces of the same material, fade curve
  and pan-law checks, plugin frequency/dynamics responses, elastic-audio quality, automation
  timing. Pro Tools is installed; it can be driven black-box with synthetic sessions (outputs kept
  under `plan/`, never committed).
- **Estimate:** ≈ 20–30 h for the harness and the first 20 scored cases; turns many "≈" in
  target-app-parity.md into measurements.

### G-08. Built-in plugins

See [`plugin-parity.md`](plugin-parity.md): 26 processors + 2 instruments against Pro Tools'
roughly 80 bundled processors and instruments; no fidelity checks; generic parameter UIs; EQ
parametric request #139. ≈ 80–120 h.

### G-09. Localization

See [`localization-parity.md`](localization-parity.md): no catalog, every string literal in code;
egui has no complex-script shaping or RTL; no CJK font fallback (PR #141 open). ≈ 70–110 h plus
native-speaker review.

### G-10. Control surfaces

None: no HUI or Mackie Control, no EUCON (Avid-proprietary, needs Avid's SDK: owner decision),
no generic MIDI controller mapping. Pro Tools users on S1/S3/S4/S6/Dock or HUI devices can't
switch. ≈ 40–70 h for HUI/MCU plus a mapping layer; hardware needed to verify.

### G-11. Sync

No MTC/LTC chase or generation, no MIDI Beat Clock (`setup.midi_beat_clock` stores a flag only),
no video reference or word clock awareness, no Satellite-style linking. ≈ 15–25 h after G-01/G-02.

### G-12. Immersive delivery

No Dolby Atmos renderer integration, ADM BWF import/export, re-renders, binaural monitoring,
MPEG-H (new in Pro Tools 2026.4), surround/object automation. ≈ 50–80 h; Dolby's renderer and
SDKs are licensed, so we'd write our own ADM and object renderer.

### G-13. Plugin ecosystem depth

No sidechain (key input) buses for any host; no ARA (Melodyne-style editing is a menu in Pro
Tools); plugins run in-process, so a crashing plugin can take the session down. ≈ 30–50 h. AAX
cannot be hosted (#109): Avid's AAX SDK licence and PACE signing; owner decision, likely never.

### G-14. Platforms and CI

Only `freebsd.yml` and `windows-arm64.yml` run on pull requests, and only for manifest paths;
nothing runs `cargo xtask ci` on PRs. Windows and Linux have startup and rendering reports
(#41, #45, #107, #142). ≈ 20–40 h (a PR CI matrix plus runtime smoke tests on three OSes).

### G-15. Elastic Audio depth

One warp algorithm; Pro Tools offers several per track (polyphonic, rhythmic, monophonic,
varispeed, high-quality offline) plus Elastic Pitch and warp-marker editing depth. ≈ 30–45 h.

### G-16. Session management

No session templates, track presets, workspace/sound browser with previews, batch rename (new in
2026.4), disk-usage and relink depth. ≈ 25–40 h.

### G-17. Video and post

No HEVC, DNxHD/HR or AV1 decode; no bounce with video; no external timecode/9-pin; no iXML
field-recorder conform. ≈ 30–50 h.

### G-18. Speech-to-text

Pro Tools transcribes dialogue to a searchable transcript (upgraded in 2026.4). We have a
settings command only. Needs an openly licensed local speech model. ≈ 30–50 h.

### G-19. UI feel

See [`ui-parity.md`](ui-parity.md). ≈ 60–100 h.

### G-20. MIDI and instrument depth

MIDI learn, a sampler (PR #108), drum machine depth, notation editing (tuplets, lyrics,
articulations, parts). ≈ 40–60 h.

### G-21. Compressed export

Bounce writes WAV/BWF/RF64, AIFF and FLAC; Pro Tools also writes MP3 and AAC/M4A in Bounce Mix.
≈ 10–20 h (pure-Rust encoders).

### G-22. Avid cloud services

Collaboration, cloud projects, Sketch, Splice, Learn, sign-in: 11 of the 30 menu leaves still
missing. Out of scope unless the owner decides otherwise.
