# Architecture

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-10 · **Change:** minor (crate diagram brought up to date: video, vst3-host, au-host; device I/O limits) · **Target:** Avid Pro Tools Ultimate 2026.4.1

SoundCraft is a Cargo workspace of small crates with enforced layering (`cargo xtask layers`).
Nothing below the UI knows about egui, so the interface can be replaced.

```
L0  time        audio-io        midi        video   (standalone: no workspace deps)
L1  dsp         clap-host   vst3-host   au-host     (plugins; the three hosts are the only crates
                                                     allowed `unsafe`, confined to their FFI modules)
L2  model                                       (the session document)
L3  mix                                         (the mix engine)
L4  engine      playback                        (commands, undo, I/O · audio devices)
L5  automation                                  (MCP server, control-channel client)
L6  ui-egui                                     (the user interface)
    apps: soundcraft (desktop) · soundcraft-cli · soundcraft-web (wasm)
```

## The document

`soundcraft_model::Session` is plain data (serde): tracks with playlists of clips, mixer state
(inserts, sends, routing, automation lanes), tempo and meter maps, memory locations, groups,
busses, and `EditState` (selection, tools, modes, view flags). Decoded audio lives in a
`SourcePool` of `Arc`s that is not serialised; cloning a session is cheap. Sessions save as
`.scraft` JSON plus an `Audio Files/` folder.

## Commands and undo

Every user action is a `CommandSpec` (id, label, menu path, shortcut, params doc, enabled, run)
registered in `crates/engine/src/cmd/`. `Engine::execute(id, params)` runs it, catches any escaped
panic, and pushes an undo snapshot (the previous `Arc<Session>`) when the document changed.
Continuous gestures use `execute_merged` so a fader drag is one undo step. Menus are built from
the incumbent's menu catalog (`crates/engine/catalog/menus.txt`); a menu item lights up when a
command has the same menu path and label (or an alias maps it), which also drives the parity
report.

## Audio

`soundcraft_mix::MixEngine::render(session, pos, frames, out)` renders one block: clips (gain,
fades, clip effects) → trim → inserts → pre-fader sends → fader/mute (automation, VCA, trim
automation) → post-fader sends → pan → busses → aux inputs → master faders. Independent strips
process in parallel; plugin delay compensation aligns every path. The same engine renders
bounces offline (`render_range`) and realtime playback (`soundcraft_playback::Player`, which owns
it on the audio thread and receives new session snapshots through a channel).

Device I/O today is the system's *default* output and *default* input device, opened as two
separate cpal streams; the mix renders 512-sample blocks and resamples to the device rate when
they differ. There is no device or buffer-size selection, no ASIO, and no MIDI device layer yet
(see [`hardware-parity.md`](hardware-parity.md)). Sources are decoded whole into the `SourcePool`
and recordings are captured in memory until stop.

`soundcraft-video` holds our own H.264, ProRes and Motion JPEG decoders and the ISO-BMFF demuxer
for the video track. Hosted plugins (`clap-host`, `vst3-host`, `au-host`) are scanned, created and
destroyed off the audio thread; only `process` runs on it.

The cpal callbacks mark their thread (`soundcraft_playback::mark_audio_thread`). Code that may run
there can ask `on_audio_thread()` before doing anything that blocks; the desktop app's logger does,
so a `log::` record from the audio thread (a stream error, a full synth event queue, a hosted
plugin's failed `process`, a CLAP plugin's own log call) is kept without waiting and written later
by the UI thread (see README › Logs).

## Agent control

The desktop app's control channel (JSON lines over TCP) exposes engine commands, inspection,
synthetic input and screenshots; `soundcraft-cli mcp` wraps either a headless engine or a running
app as an MCP server. See `control-protocol.md` and `mcp.md`.
