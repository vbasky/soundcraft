## What it does

SoundCraft follows the workflow audio engineers already know: an **Edit window** for arranging and
editing, a **Mix window** for balancing, edit modes, tools, playlists, memory locations, AudioSuite
processing and the rest. If you've spent years in that workflow, your hands should already know
where things are.

  with seventy-odd tracks playing.

## Getting started

Download a build from the [releases page](https://github.com/storytold/soundcraft/releases), or build
from source with a recent stable Rust:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/soundcraft
cd soundcraft
cargo run --release -p soundcraft -- --demo     # opens the demo song
```

Linux needs the ALSA headers (`libasound2-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `alsa-lib-devel` on Fedora).

The web build:

```sh
cd apps/soundcraft-web && trunk serve --release   # then open http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Useful shortcuts: <kbd>Space</kbd> play/stop, <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>=</kbd> Mix/Edit,
<kbd>F1</kbd>–<kbd>F4</kbd> edit modes, <kbd>F5</kbd>–<kbd>F10</kbd> tools, <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>E</kbd>
separate, <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> duplicate, <kbd>Enter</kbd> new marker, <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>N</kbd>
new tracks. **Setup › Keyboard Shortcuts** lists them all.

### Logs

The desktop app writes its `log` records to standard error and to `logs/soundcraft.log` in the
settings directory, beside `ui.json`, `Autosave/` and `Presets/` (Linux `~/.config/soundcraft/logs/`,
or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/soundcraft/logs/`; macOS `~/Library/Application Support/SoundCraft/logs/`;
Windows `%APPDATA%\SoundCraft\logs\`). A start from a desktop menu or the Dock has no terminal, so
this file is what to attach to a bug report: the engine's panic report, audio devices that failed to
open or broke, plugins that refused their stored state, CLAP plugins' own messages and files that
failed to open land there. Each launch moves the previous log to `soundcraft.1.log` (and that one to
`soundcraft.2.log`), so the log of a run that crashed survives the next start. The file stops
growing at 16 MiB. `--version` writes no file, and runs with `SOUNDCRAFT_NO_PREFS` log to standard
error only.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RUST_LOG` | Log levels for standard error and the log file. Default: `info` for SoundCraft's own crates, `warn` for everything else. env_logger-style directives replace that, e.g. `RUST_LOG=debug`, `RUST_LOG=warn,soundcraft_mix=trace` or `RUST_LOG=info,wgpu_core=warn`; a directive ending in `*` covers every target starting with it (`soundcraft*=debug`). |
| `SOUNDCRAFT_NO_PREFS` | No preferences read or written and no log file (agents' test runs). |

The realtime audio thread never writes a record itself: the logger keeps the first one it logs
(without waiting or allocating), counts the rest, and the UI thread writes them. The logger is
`apps/soundcraft/src/logging.rs`. The web app logs to the browser console instead.

## For agents and scripts

Everything you can click is also a command with an id and JSON parameters, and the same commands
are reachable from the menus, the keyboard, the command line, a JSON control channel and an
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server. Programmatic calls never open dialogs, and
`session.inspect` reports exactly what changed, so an agent can check its own work.

```sh
# Headless: load the demo, turn the kick down, add an EQ, bounce.
soundcraft-cli run --demo \
  --cmd 'mix.volume={"track":"Kick","db":-6}' \
  --cmd 'mix.insert={"track":"Bass","plugin":"eq_7band"}' \
  --bounce mix.wav

# Drive the running app.
soundcraft --demo --control 7801 &
soundcraft-cli app --port 7801 transport.play
soundcraft-cli app --port 7801 ui.screenshot '{"path":"shot.png"}'

# Give Claude a DAW.
claude mcp add soundcraft -- soundcraft-cli mcp --demo
```

See [`docs/control-protocol.md`](docs/control-protocol.md) and [`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md).
`soundcraft-cli commands` lists every command.

Open **SoundCraft › Session Audio Health** to check loaded audio availability, sample-rate
mismatches and clip source bounds across all playlists, including alternate takes. The report
offers a refresh button and suggests how to resolve each issue. Scripts can obtain the same JSON
report with `soundcraft-cli run --demo --cmd 'session.audio_health={}'`. This checks loaded media,
not files on disk, signal levels, plugins or routing.

## How it's built

SoundCraft is a Cargo workspace of small crates with strict layering: nothing below the UI knows
about egui, so the interface could be swapped for another one.

| Crate | What it does |
|---|---|
| `soundcraft-time` | Timebases, tempo and meter maps, timecode, grid |
| `soundcraft-audio-io` | Audio file formats and waveform overviews |
| `soundcraft-midi` | Standard MIDI Files and MIDI operations |
| `soundcraft-dsp` | Plugins, offline processing, meters, loudness, FFT |
| `soundcraft-model` | The session document |
| `soundcraft-mix` | The mix engine (realtime and offline share it) |
| `soundcraft-engine` | Commands, undo, editing, import/export, bounce |
| `soundcraft-playback` | Audio devices (CoreAudio, WASAPI, ALSA, WebAudio) and recording |
| `soundcraft-automation` | MCP server and control-channel client |
| `soundcraft-ui-egui` | The user interface |

The code never panics on bad input: errors are values, and a malformed file or a bad agent call
produces a message, never a crash. `cargo xtask ci` runs formatting, clippy, the tests, the asset
and layering checks and the WebAssembly build.

## Status and roadmap

SoundCraft is **pre-alpha**: it covers 94 % of the incumbent's menu items (measured), about 70 % of
its features by presence, and is roughly 40 % of the way to replacing it for real work: record,
edit, mix and bounce work end to end, but choosing an audio interface and buffer size,
recording MIDI from a controller and session interchange (AAF/OMF) are still missing, and those
are the alpha checklist. Translations are missing too. The status, the stage and our effort
estimates are in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md); the full assessment is in
[`docs/target-app-parity.md`](docs/target-app-parity.md), the ranked list of what's missing in
[`docs/gaps.md`](docs/gaps.md), and the menu-by-menu comparison in
[`docs/parity-checklist.md`](docs/parity-checklist.md). Bug reports and wish lists are
very welcome, in the issues or on Discord.

## Downloads

**Download SoundCraft** from GitHub: the [latest release](https://github.com/storytold/soundcraft/releases/latest) has every build listed below, and [all releases](https://github.com/storytold/soundcraft/releases) has earlier versions and their notes. `<ver>` in the file names is the version number, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists a checksum for every file.

### Windows

| Build | Installer | Portable |
|---|---|---|
| x64 (64-bit Intel/AMD) | `soundcraft-<ver>-windows-x64.msi` | `soundcraft-<ver>-windows-x64-portable.zip` |
| arm64 (Snapdragon and other ARM PCs) | `soundcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64.msi` | `soundcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` |
| x86 (32-bit) | `soundcraft-<ver>-windows-x86.msi` | `soundcraft-<ver>-windows-x86-portable.zip` |

Installers and executables are code-signed.

**If the app doesn't open on Windows:** the desktop app initializes only DirectX 12 by default.
Letting wgpu also create an OpenGL instance can crash some graphics drivers (AMD's
`atio6axx.dll`) before the window appears, so the app would flash in Task Manager and quit.
`WGPU_BACKEND` overrides the default for troubleshooting (for example `dx12` or `vulkan`). In
PowerShell, from the folder containing the executable:

```powershell
$env:WGPU_BACKEND = "vulkan"
& .\soundcraft.exe
Remove-Item Env:WGPU_BACKEND                     # restore the default for later launches
```

An explicit `gl` override can bring the driver crash back on affected systems. The macOS, Linux
and web backend defaults are unchanged.
